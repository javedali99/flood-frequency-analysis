## Flood frequency analysis of annual maximum discharge time series

Term project on "Flood Frequency Analysis" for "Water Resources in Changing Environment" class at [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/).  

This interactive web application was built using the `Shiny` package in `R` for showing the results of flood frequency analysis.

### Data source

- [U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Information System](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/peak).

- Peak discharge data for 8 gauge stations on Pearl river, Mississippi were selected for the flood frequency analysis.

```



### Probability distributions

We used following probability distributions for modelling annual maximum streamflow time series:

- Normal distribution

- Lognormal distribution

- Gamma distribution

- Pearson type 3 distribution

- Log-Pearson type 3 distribution

- Gumbel distribution

- Weibull distribution

- Exponential distribution


### Estimation methods

We selected following methods for estimating parameters of the distributions for this study: 

- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)

- Method of Moments (MOM)

- Probability Weighted Moments (PWM)


### Goodness of fit tests

Goodness-of-fit tests are used to summarize the discrepancy between a statistical model and the observed data. They are useful for comparing the observed values with either the values fitted by a model of interest or theoretical quantiles of a known sampling distribution. We used following metrics for determining whether a fit is satisfactory or not. 

- Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S) 

- Anderson-Darling test (A-D) 

- Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)

- Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)

- L-moment ratio diagram
